Find the second minimum element of an array.

Input:  arr = [2, 3, -1, 10, -34, 1]
Output: The smallest element is -34 and 
        second Smallest element is -1.

Solution 1: is to sort the array in increasing order. 
The first two elements in sorted array would be two smallest elements. 
Time complexity of this solution is O(n Log n).

Solution 2: find the minimum two elements in one traversal.

Algorithm:
1) Initialize both first and second smallest as INT_MAX
   first = second = INT_MAX
2) Loop through all the elements.
   a) If the current element is smaller than first, then update first 
       and second. 
   b) Else if the current element is smaller than second then update 
    second.

def find_second_min(arr):
	# There should be atleast two elements 
    arr_size = len(arr) 
    if arr_size < 2: 
        print "Invalid Input"
        return
	
	min, second_min = float("-inf"), float("-inf")
	
	for number in arr:
		if number <= min:
			min, second_min = number, min
		elif number != min and number <= second_min:
			second_min = number
	return second_min
